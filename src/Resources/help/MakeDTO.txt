The <info>%command.name%</info> command generates a new data transfer object class.

<info>php %command.full_name% Name Entity</info>

If the argument is missing, the command will ask for the classname and entity interactively.

The command will further ask for:
 - the generation of helper methods to extract/fill data from entities into DTO
 - the generation of getters and setters for the properties
 - whether the id field should be omitted in the DTO
